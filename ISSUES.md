This represents the same instant of time as noon, January 1, 1937, Netherlands time. 
Standard time in the Netherlands was exactly 19 minutes and 32.13 seconds ahead of UTC by law from 1909-05-01 through 1937-06-30.
This time zone cannot be represented exactly using the HH:MM format, and this timestamp uses the closest representable UTC offset.
